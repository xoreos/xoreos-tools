boost.m4
********
   xoreos-tools uses Benoit Sigoure's boost.m4 autoconf macros
   (<https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4>) to check for the needed Boost
   libraries. boost.m4 is licensed under version 3 or later of the GNU General
   Public License. For the full license text, see COPYING or
   <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.

UTF-8 CPP
*********
   xoreos-tools uses the lightweight header-only UTF-8 CPP library
   (<https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp>) for handling UTF-8 encoded strings.
   UTF-8 CPP is licensed under the Boost Software License. See
   external/utf8cpp/LICENSE or <https://www.boost.org/users/license.html>
   for details.

ScummVM code
************
   xoreos-tools uses some ScummVM (<https://scummvm.org/>) code, most
   prominently the endian, singleton and stream code. ScummVM is licensed under
   version 2 or later of the GNU General Public License. For the full license
   text, see doc/LICENSE.GPLv2 or <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>.

Nintendo DS formats
*******************
   xoreos-tools includes readers for various Nintendo DS file formats, based on
   code in Tinke by pleoNeX (<https://github.com/pleonex/tinke>), licensed
   under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License. For the full
   license text, see COPYING or <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>.
   They are also based on lowlines' file format specifications
   (<http://llref.emutalk.net/docs/>) and the Nintendo DS information
   documentation GBATEK by Martin Korth (<https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm>).

Google Test
***********
   xoreos-tools uses Google Test (<https://github.com/google/googletest>),
   Google's C++ test framework. Google Test is licensed under the terms of the
   3-clause BSD license. For the full license text, see tests/googletest/LICENSE
   or <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/LICENSE>.

libmspack
*********
   xoreos uses libmspack, a library for Microsoft compression formats
   (<https://www.cabextract.org.uk/libmspack/>). This is needed to handle
   Xbox LZX decoding. Since the library does not offer a direct API to
   the LZX decoding, xoreos completely includes the library code. libmspack
   is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1.
   For the full license text, see external/mspack/COPYING.LIB or
   <https://gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>.

UEViewer
********
   xoreos includes code based on UEViewer (<https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel>)
   to handle the Xbox LZX decompression. UEViewer is licensed under the terms of the
   MIT license. For the full license text, see <<https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>.
