# Project version information, including git repository information.

# Query the git repository (if available) and ask for:
# - The last description tag
# - The current revision hash (shortened)
# - The number of commits between the last tag and HEAD
# - Is the repository checkout dirty?
#
# Then put all this information into the gitstamp file, but only if
# if the current contents of the file does not different from what
# we have just read from the repository. This guarantees that the
# version file is only recompiled if the repository information
# changed.

# should go into src_version_libversion_la_CXXFLAGS, i.e. the build
# flags variable for this library. However, when there are library
# build flags, automake will rename the object files to include the
# library name (so prevent linker issues due to mismatched flags)
# and for some reason, the following dependency override rule doesn't
# work for the renamed src_version_libversion-version.lo.
