.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
converts Nintendo's tile-based NCGR images into common TGA images.
.Pp
2D graphics on the Nintendo DS is fundamentally tile-based.
Specifically, the graphics data in NCGR is ordered in tiles of 8\(mu8
pixels.
Moreover, an NCGR file can itself be a tile of a larger image.
This tool can automatically combine and unwrap these tiles,
and, together with an NCLR file for the palette, converts a grid
of NCGR into a plain old linear TGA image.
