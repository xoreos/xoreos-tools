.Ar command
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
extracts BioWare KEY/BIF archives, found in many BioWare games.
.Pp
KEY and BIF files are fundamentally linked: a KEY file contains file
names and types, while the BIF file contains the file data itself.
At the same time, a KEY file can control several BIF files.
.Pp
For example:
.Pp
.Pa foo.key
controls:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Pa foo1.bif
.It
Pa foo2.bif
.It
Pa foo3.bif
.El
.Pp
.Pa foo.key
indexes:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Pa bar.are
and
.Pa bar.git
from
.Pa foo1.bif
.It
.Pa qux.utc
from
.Pa foo2.bif
.It
.Pa baz.txt
from
.Pa foo3.bif
.El
.Pp
If you want to extract all files indexed by
.Pa foo.key ,
you need to also specify
.Pa foo1.bif , foo2.bif
and
.Pa foo3.bif
on the command.
If
.Pa foo3.bif
is missing,
.Pa baz.txt
will not be extracted.
However, listing file only requires the KEY.
