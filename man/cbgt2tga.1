.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
converts CBGT image files into common TGA images.
CBGT, Compressed BackGround Tiles,
are used as area background images in BioWare's Nintendo DS game
.Em Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood .
.Pp
Internally, a CBGT consists of a collection of 64\(mu64 pixel cells,
divided into tiles of 8\(mu8 pixels.
Each cell is compressed using Nintendo's 0x10 LZSS algorithm.
Moreover, PAL files with the same
name as the CBGT file contain the palette data, and 2DA files with
the same name yet again contain the mapping of palette indices onto
cells.
.Pp
The width and height of the final image is not stored within the
CBGT file, but the palette mapping 2DA does contain the number
cells in X and Y direction, since it stores the palette indices
in a two-dimensional array of those dimensions.
Therefore, multiplying the number of columns and rows in said 2DA by 64 yields
the width and height, respectively, of the final image.
