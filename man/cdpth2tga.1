.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cdpth2tga
.Op Ar options
.Ar cdpth 2da tga
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
converts CDPTH depth information files into common TGA images.
CDPTH, Compressed DePTH, are used as depth information for area
background images in BioWare's Nintendo DS game
.Em Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood .
.Pp
Layout-wise, a CDPTH is stored similar to CBGT:
cells of 64\(mu64 pixels, compressed using Nintendo's 0x10 LZSS algorithm.
Unlike CBGT, though, the cells themselves are
.Em not
swizzled into 8\(mu8
tiles, and the pixel value in CDPTH is a 16bit integer specifying
a depth.
.Pp
The width and height of the final image is not stored within the
CDPTH file, and has to be provided from the outside, like from
the dimensions of the CBGT image, the dimensions of the 2DA file
for the CBGT image.
.Pp
The depth information is stored as 16-bit values, but only the
lower 15 bits are used.
For conversion into a grayscale image, those 15 bits of grayscale
information are further compressed to 8-bit.

.It Ar cdpth
The name of the CDPTH file to read.
The CDPTH contains the depth information part of the image.
.It Ar 2da
The name of the 2DA file to use.
The 2DA is necessary to know how many cells are in the CDPTH file.
.It Ar tga
The resulting TGA file will be written there.
