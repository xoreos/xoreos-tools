.Nm tlk2xml

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
converts BioWare's TLK files into human-readable XML.
TLK are
.Dq talk tables ,
a list of strings indexed by an ID, used for all
user-visible text in a BioWare game.
All strings for a campaign
or module are usually collected in one file for each supported
language, and languages with sentences that vary wildly depending
on whether the player character is male or female use a second
TLK with strings for the female version.
.Pp
There's two distinct TLK formats.
One is a whole separate file
format (which uses version IDs V3.0 and V4.0), the other is a
GFF (and uses version IDs V0.2 and V0.5).
Within those two major versions, the differences are smaller:
V4.0 removed fields for each string not needed anymore,
and V0.5 compresses strings using a Huffman tree.
This tool can read all of these variants
and produces a human-read XML file.
.Pp
Because these files contain localized string data, it is important
to know the encoding of those strings.
Unfortunately, the TLK
files do not contain information about the encoding.
Version 3.0 and 4.0 contain a language identifier,
but the meaning of that varies between games.
V0.2 and V0.5 even lack those completely.
However, due to the Huffman-nature of V0.5 strings, the encoding
there is fixed to little-endian UTF-16, and strings in V0.2 files
are also usually in little-endian UTF-16 (with the exceptions of
files found in the Nintendo DS game
.Em Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood ) .
To manually select the encoding, this tool provides a wide range
command line options for various encodings.
.Pp
Alternatively, the game this TLK is from can be specified and
.Nm
will read the strings in an appropriate encoding for that
game and the language ID found in the TLK.
Please note that this does not work for the game
.Em Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood ,
since its TLK files do not provide a language ID.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Convert the CP-1252 TLK
.Pa file1.tlk
into an XML file:
.Pp
.Dl $ tlk2xml --cp1252 file1.tlk file2.xml
.Pp
Convert the UTF-16LE TLK
.Pa file1.tlk
into an XML file on
.Dv stdout :
.Pp
.Dl $ tlk2xml --utf16le file1.tlk
.Pp
Convert the TLK
.Pa file1.tlk
from Neverwinter Nights into an XML file:
.Pp
.Dl $ tlk2xml --nwn file1.tlk file2.xml
.Pp
Convert the UTF-8 TLK
.Pa file1.tlk
into an XML file on
.Dv stdout ,
modify it using
.Xr sed 1
and use
.Xr xml2tlk 1
to write it back into a TLK:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxxxx
$ tlk2xml --utf8 file1.tlk | sed -e 's/gold/candy/g' | xml2tlk \e
  --utf8 --version30 file2.tlk
